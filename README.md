# Minimal Autograd Neural Net in NumPy

This repo contains a super minimal neural network library and training loop using only NumPy. The file defines a tiny tensor/autograd engine inspired by PyTorch, supporting basic operations and gradient descent. The script includes an example linear regression training run at the bottom. Just for learning fun :)
